            I am a Graphic Designer with <strong>17+ years of experience</strong> in remote projects for US-based, Australia, and Canada clients.
          </p>
          <p>
            I specialise in <strong>advertising & promotional campaigns/materials</strong>, <strong>book and eBook design</strong>, <strong>UI design</strong>, and <strong>customised solutions</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have proven skills in managing complex projects, cross-cultural communication, and meeting deadlines using <strong>Figma</strong> and <strong>Adobe Creative Suite</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each project I approach is an opportunity to tell a unique story. I believe that good design is not just about aesthetics, but about effective communication and creating an emotional connection.
